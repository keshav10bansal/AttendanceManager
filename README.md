# 🎯 Attendance Management System (Java)

**Development Timeline:** October 1 – October 15, 2025

This is a simple **Java console-based Attendance Management System** that allows users to mark daily attendance, view attendance reports, and calculate attendance percentages.  
I created this project to practice **loops, arrays, switch-case statements, and real-world logic building** in Java.

## 💡 Features

- **Add Students** – Input names of students at the start.  
- **Mark Attendance** – Mark each student as Present (P) or Absent (A).  
- **View Report** – See attendance summary with total days and percentage.  
- **Exit Option** – Cleanly exit the system anytime.

All operations are handled through a simple menu-driven interface in the console.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Using **arrays** to store and track data across sessions.  
- Applying **switch-case** for clean menu navigation.  
- Handling **user input validation** and character checking.  
- Calculating **percentages and simple analytics** in Java.
